			<ul>
				<li>
					<p>
						<em>Bitclash</em> is a web-based animated widget that turns bits
						into hit points and lets your Twitch viewers battle for dominance!
					</p>
				</li>
				<li>
					Combat
					<p>
						Challengers get as many hit points as the number of bits in their cheer
						and face off against the current defender (initially the channel owner)
						and the defender's remaining hit points.
					</p>
					<p>
						The challenger and the current defender take turns to fight each other
						until one of them is defeated. The number of hits and damage dealt are
						scaled according to the size of the challenger's cheer. The damage dealt
						is random but, without (optional) critical hits, should sum to around
						105% of the challenger's cheer on average.
					</p>
					<p>
						Critical hits, if enabled, boost a single hit's damage by a multiplier.
						Critical hit chance is <em>per match-up</em>; the challenger and defender
						will throw at most one critical hit in each fight.
					</p>
					<p>
						If the challenger defeats the current defender then they become the
						new defender and (optionally) get a boost to their hit points. The
						defender can also heal themselves by cheering but their health cannot
						exceed their maximum hit points.
					</p>
				</li>

					Using <em>Bitclash</em>
					<p>
						<em>Bitclash</em> is intended for use as a webpage/URL source in your
						broadcast software. It can also be captured from a web browser although
						typically that won't support a transparent background and you may need
						to use chroma keying to achieve transparency.
					</p>
					<p>
						To authorize <em>Bitclash</em> for your channel click the <em>Configure
						Bitclash</em> button below. In standard usage <em>Bitclash</em> requires
						permission to view your user details. A test mode that listens for whispers
						instead of cheers can be enabled; this will require an additional permission
						to be able to access your Twitch chat which can be revoked once testing is
						complete. Once authorized a URL will be generated for <em>Bitclash</em>
						containing your authorization token and selected configuration.
					</p>
					<p>
						<em>Bitclash</em> should work with any browser or embedded browser with
						support for JavaScript and cookies. The current state of combat and any
						queued cheers are saved to a persistent browser cookie and will be restored
						if the widget is closed and re-opened. The current defender can be reset to
						a specific user and/or number of hit points as a one-time update via the
						settings page; this will also clear the current challenger and any fight
						that is in progress but will not remove any queued cheers. If your
						webpage/URL source supports interaction with the widget or you are using
						<em>Bitclash</em> in a browser players' avatars can be swapped for a
						default image by clicking on the avatar.
					</p>
					<p>
						No information is stored on <em>Bitclash</em>'s server. The combat details,
						queued cheers, and settings are all stored on your machine. <em>Bitclash</em>
						is only able to queue viewer's cheers whilst the <em>Bitclash</em> window
						is open as a source or in a browser. <em>Bitclash</em> is provided for
						entertainment purposes; no liability can be accepted for any defects, outages,
						or loss of game data.
